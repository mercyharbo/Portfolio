                        Hello, I am Mercy from Osun, Nigeria, a Frontend Developer & WordPress Developer passionate
                        about creating amazing stuff for the internet. My interest started in 2018 when I met someone
                        studying computer science at University like me that put me through how and where to start
                        learning to code, after doing research I find out about W3school, udemy, and YouTube which
                        helped my journey as I was just getting to know about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first
                        time then. Since then I have improved my tech career through making research, learning new
                        languages, networking, building and collaborating with other developers on projects.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm skilled in JavaScript, React js, Node/express js, Git & Github, CSS, SCSS, and
                        I'm a team person, working together with people has helped me develop because I tend
                        to learn and challenge myself to do more. Over the years, I have learned to pick
                        different projects beyond me just to improve my coding skill, which has helped me.
                        I pick projects from Frontendmentor, Dribble and more.
                    </p>
